# Stockbot
This is a program to collect and analize trades from members of Congress. It has generally good returns, and in my 6 month test, its recommendations outperformed the S&P 500.

# Usage

Import the yfinance library with ```pip install yfinance```

After running the program, it will print 3 stocks to the terminal. These recommendations will change every 2-3 weeks.
